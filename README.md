##Exercise information from the book Visual C# How to Program

Write an app that uses random-number generation to create sentences. Use four arrays of strings, called article, noun, verb and preposition.
Create a sentece by selecting a word at random from each array in the following order: artice, noun, verb, preposition, article, noun. As each 
word is picked, concatenate it to the previous words in the sentence. The words should be separated by spaces. When the sentence is output, it
should start with a capital letter and end with a period. The program should generate 10 sentences and output them to a text box.

the nouns: boy, girl, dog, town and car. The verb array shoud contain the past-tense verbs: drove,jumped, ran, walked and skipped. The preposition
array should contain the prepositions: to, from, over, under and on.
